# infoboard

> Infoboard showing time, weather, calendar events, photos from local folder or online sources as background and Transport for London status updates.  
> Intended for Raspberry Pi, but should work on any machine with NodeJS available.

## Features

- Almost everything is configurable in `.env` file;
- Show current time and date;
- Calendar events from an iCal format link,
- Background images, changing every 60 seconds. Source of images can be:
  - a local folder,
  - view Exif information only for images from local folder,
  - [NASA Picture of the day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html),
  - random image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/),
  - curated images from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/),
  - both Unsplash and Pexels also support showing images tagged with current weather conditions: "light rain", "mostly clear" and so on,
  - weather tagged photos from [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/);
- MP4 videos played as the background;
- Current weather and weekly forecast from [Tomorrow.io](https://www.tomorrow.io/) formerly ClimaCell;
- Additional weather details include:
  - humidity,
  - wind speed,
  - barometric pressure,
  - air quality (PM2.5 and PM10),
  - many more.
- Support for local [DHT sensor](https://www.google.com/search?q=DHT+sensor) (temperature and humidity); Check installation instructions [below](#dht-sensor-installing-and-troubleshooting);
- Transport for London status updates for tube, overground, dlr, tfl rail and tram;
- Transport for London bus timetable for bus stops you choose;
- COVID-19 stats from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). Their GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data);
- [Magic Mirror](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/magic-mirror/) mode - no background images at all, just solid black background and all text is white. This gives best contrast to use behind a magic mirror.
- Everything, except for time can be folded or expanded by clicking on their icons;
- Two buttons at the bottom right corner allow skipping to the next image or skip the entire folder to the next one (for local images source only);
- If your browser supports programmatic fullscreen mode, a third button will appear to switch browser to fullscreen;
- Runs as a responsive website therefore can be accessed on any device;
- Available as [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) (Progressive Web Application) - add a shortcut to infoboard that looks just like an app on your phone or tablet and don't bother using a browser.
